Almost every action we take in today’s digital world relies on cryptography.
 .Encryption safeguards our personal and business transactions.
 .Digital signatures on software updates confirm the authenticity of their creator or supplier.
From online banking to secure software deployment, cryptography works silently in the background to keep our data safe and trustworthy.

Cryptography is nothing but the science of protecting information by transforming it into an unreadable format (encryption) so that only authorized parties can read or use it (decryption).

In short:
Cryptography = Art + Science of securing data using math, algorithms, and keys.
It’s like writing a secret letter in a code only your friend knows how to read — except instead of simple codes, we use strong mathematical formulas so even the world’s fastest computers struggle to break them.
