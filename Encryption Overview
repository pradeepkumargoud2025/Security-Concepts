🔐 Cryptography in Our Digital World

Almost every action we take in today’s digital world relies on cryptography.

Encryption safeguards personal and business transactions.

Digital signatures verify the authenticity of software updates.

From online banking to secure software deployment, cryptography works silently in the background to keep our data safe and trustworthy.

📖 What is Cryptography?

Cryptography is the science of protecting information by transforming it into an unreadable format (encryption) so that only authorized parties can read or use it (decryption).

In short:

Cryptography = Art + Science of securing data using math, algorithms, and keys

It’s like writing a secret letter in a code only your friend knows how to read — except instead of simple codes, we use strong mathematical formulas so even the world’s fastest computers struggle to break them.
