üîê Cryptography in Our Digital World

Almost every action we take in today‚Äôs digital world relies on cryptography.

Encryption safeguards personal and business transactions.

Digital signatures verify the authenticity of software updates.

From online banking to secure software deployment, cryptography works silently in the background to keep our data safe and trustworthy.

üìñ What is Cryptography?

Cryptography is the science of protecting information by transforming it into an unreadable format (encryption) so that only authorized parties can read or use it (decryption).

In short:

Cryptography = Art + Science of securing data using math, algorithms, and keys

It‚Äôs like writing a secret letter in a code only your friend knows how to read ‚Äî except instead of simple codes, we use strong mathematical formulas so even the world‚Äôs fastest computers struggle to break them.

Cryptography is used to protect information by keeping its meaning or content secret and making it unintelligible to someone who does not have a way to decrypt (unlock) that protected information.

The objective of every encryption system is to transform an original set of data, called the plaintext, into an otherwise unintelligible encrypted form, called the cipher ext.

Properly used, singly or in combination, cryptographic solutions provide a range of services that can help achieve required systems security postures in many ways:

Confidentiality: Cryptography provides con identiality by hiding or obscuring a message so that it cannot be understood by anyone except the intended recipient. Con identiality keeps information secret from those who are not
authorized to have it.

Integrity: Hash functions and digital signatures can provide integrity services that allow a recipient to verify that a message has not been altered by malice or error. These include simple message integrity controls.
Any changes made by the sender or the recipient, either deliberate or accidental, will result in two di ferent results.

Encryption System: An encryption system is a set of hardware, software, algorithms, control parameters, and operational methods that provide a set of encryption services.

Plaintext: Plaintext is the data or message in its normal, unencrypted form and format. Its meaning or value to an end user (a person or a process) is immediately available for use.

Plaintext can be:
‚óè Image, audio, or video iles in their raw or compressed forms
‚óè Human-readable text and numeric data, with or without markup language elements for formatting and metadata
‚óè Database iles or records and ields within a database
‚óè Anything else that can be represented in digital form for computer processing, transmission, and storage

Note: It is impor ant to remember that plaintext can be anything and that much of it is not readable to humans.
