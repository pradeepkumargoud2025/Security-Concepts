What is Security Awareness Training?

Let’s start with a clear understanding of the three different types of learning activities that organizations use, whether for information security or for any other purpose:

Education: The overall goal of education is to help learners improve their understanding of these ideas and their ability to relate them to their own experiences and apply that learning in useful ways.

Training: Focuses on building proficiency in a specific set of skills or actions, including sharpening the perception and judgment needed to make decisions as to which skill to use, when to use it and how to apply it. Training can focus on low-level skills, an entire task, or complex workflows consisting of many tasks.

Awareness: These are activities that attract and engage the learner’s attention by acquainting them with aspects of an issue, concern, problem, or need.
